Charcoal CMS
============

The CMS Charcoal Module (_Content Management System_). Provides basic objects to build a website.
Notably, `Section` (or _page_), `News`, `Event` and `Faq` as well as to ather user data, notably `ContactInquiry`.

This module is heavily dependant on [`charcoal-object`](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/charcoal-object) (and therefore `charcoal-core`) which provides the base `Content` class the CMS objects are dependant on, as well as many trait / interface behaviors.

# How to install

The preferred (and only supported) way of installing _charcoal-cms_ is with **composer**:

```shell
★ composer require locomotivemtl/charcoal-cms
```

For a complete, ready-to-use project, start from the [`charcoal project boilerplate`](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/charcoal-project-boilerplate):

```shell
★ composer create-project locomotivemtl/charcoal-project-boilerplate:@dev --prefer-source
```

## Dependencies

-   [`PHP 5.6+`](http://php.net)
    - PHP 7 is recommended for security and performance reasons.

    - Content blocks are provided with _attachments_.
-   [`locomotivemtl/charcoal-core`](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/charcoal-core)
    - Core charcoal models and storage class.
    - Provides base Model, which depends on Storable and Describable.
-   [`locomotivemtl/charcoal-object`](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/charcoal-object)
    - CMS objects are based on `\Charcoal\Object\Content`.
-   [`locomotivemtl/charcoal-translator`](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/charcoal-translator)

## Section object

A **section**, in Charcoal, is a reachable _page_ on the website, as part of the full hierarchical site map. They can be displayed in menus or breadcrumbs and be reached with a unique URL (`routable`).

Types of sections:

-   `blocks`
    -   Blocks sections define their content as a structured map of blocks.
-   `content`
    -   Content sections define their content in a single, simple _HTML_ property.
-   `empty`
    -   Empty sections are linked to a template but do not require any custom content.
-   `external`
    -   External sections are simply a redirect to an external (or internal) URL.

All section types, except _external_, make use of a `Template` object to be rendered. Typically, a charcoal `view` make sure of linking the `template` (by default, _mustache_

> Sections are standard Charcoal `Model`, meaning they are _describable_ with a `Metadata` object (which define a map of `properties`) and _storable_ with a `Source` object.

Base section properties:

### Interfaces

From model:

- `Describable`: The objects can be defined by Metadata.
- `Storable`: Objects have unique IDs and can be stored in storage / database.

From content:

- `Content`: A "managed" charcoal model (describable with metadata / storable).
- `Authorable`: Creation and modification user (admin) are kept in the storage.
- `Revisionable`: Copy of changes will be kept upon each object update in the storage.
- `Timestampable`: Creation and modification time are kept into the storage.

From charcoal-object

- `Hierarchicale`: The objects can be stacked hierarchically.
- ~~`Publishable`: Objects have publish status, date and expiry. Allows moderation.~~
- `Routable`: Objects are reachable through a URL.

From charcoal-cms:

- `Metatag`: The objects have meta-information for SEO purpose.
- `Searchable`: Extra keywords can be used to help search engine.
- `Templateable`: The objects can be rendered with a template / controller / config combo.

### Extending the section object

The `\Charcoal\Cms\Section\*` objects are `final`. To extend, use the `\Charcoal\Cms\AbstractSection` base object instead, to make sure no metadata conflicts arise.

## Tag object

**Tag** objects link any objects together by providing an extra taxonomy layer. Tags may also be used to enhance internal search engines.

## Coding Style

The `charcoal-cms` module follows the Charcoal coding-style:

-   [_PSR-1_](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md)
-   [_PSR-2_](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)
-   [_PSR-4_](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md), autoloading is therefore provided by _Composer_.
-   [_phpDocumentor_](http://phpdoc.org/) comments.
-   Read the [phpcs.xml](phpcs.xml) file for all the details on code style.

> Coding style validation / enforcement can be performed with `composer phpcs`. An auto-fixer is also available with `composer phpcbf`.
